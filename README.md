# Fish Weight Prediction

## Overview

Hello! Welcome to the famous Tsukiji Fish Market of Tokyo, Japan! We came here to collect data on some of the fish they have. 
We didn't wake up at 5am for the tuna auction and by the time we showed up there were only a few species of fish left. 
We got to work and gathered measurements from a few different species of fish.  

## Objective

We want to train a regression model using Scikit-Learn to predict the weight of a fish using some of the features we were able to measure. 

We have no idea which features will be good predictors.
